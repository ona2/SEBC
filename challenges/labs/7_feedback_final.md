This bootcamp was hard, tiring, and A LOT OF FUN.

Most of material was familiar to me, except Sentry and TLS. But Michael pointed out at very important features (common issues) that was extremely useful to learn, to try, to get puzzled with.
Great and useful challenges!

I need to work more on security section (sentry) to make it more fluent, as well as to learn CM features more in depth.


It was an absolute pleasure to work with you, Michael, Ben and Andre!
Great Bootcamp!

And thank you for the stickers, Michael!
